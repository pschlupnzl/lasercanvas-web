<H1>Introduction</H1>
<HR>

<P>LaserCanvas is a rapid-development laser beam modelling and teaching application. It uses the ABCD matrix formalism to establish cavity stability and resonant mode sizes for oscillators, and beam propagation parameters for linear optical systems. This user guide is intended as a brief introduction to LaserCanvas features.</P>

<P>The core of LaserCanvas is the design "canvas," where an optical resonator or system can be designed real-time in 2D. Optics can be moved using the mouse. Alternatively optic parameters are specified using the Property Manager, which also lists properties relating to the optical system, such as wavelength, and gives access to advanced features including variables.</P>

<P>In addition to the 2D canvas, LaserCanvas offers the following design tools:</P>

<H3>Getting Started</H3>
<P>To get started, we recommend you read the <A HREF="intro_tips.html">Top-10 Tips</A> and work through the included Tutorials. Together, these sections introduce most of the features of LaserCanvas.</P>

<H3>Bugs, Corrections, Suggestions</H3>
<P>We hope that LaserCanvas is a reliable, useful, and robust application. However, it's a very difficult task to find all bugs and errors. If you find something that's wrong, or if there's something you'd like to see added to LaserCanvas, please send us your comments. We welcome your feedback!</P>
