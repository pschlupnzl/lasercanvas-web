<P>An output coupler is a special type of optic that is intimately related to out-coupled systems.</P>

<P>Within a resonator, any <A HREF="opt_mirr.html">mirror</A> (except the top mirror) can be made partially reflective by selecting menu <U>E</U>dit | <U>O</U>utput Coupler or clicking the <NOBR><IMG SRC="but_spwn.png" WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20>&nbsp;Output</NOBR> Coupler button on the toolbar.</P>



<H3>Out-coupled System</H3>

<P>This creates a new system. The initial mode for the out-coupled system is taken from the resonant mode just before the output coupling mirror, and is then propagated through the Output Coupler optic.</P>

<P>The Output Coupler is linked to the mirror in the parent system. Properties such as face angle and radius of curvature are taken from the original mirror. The properties of the Output Coupler include only those that are necessary for transmission through the optic but not for reflection.</P>



<H3>Refractive Index</H3>

<P>Limit: &gt; 1.</P>

<P>Specifies the refractive index of the output coupler material. This determines the refraction and focusing characteristics of the output coupling mirror.</P>



<H3>Thickness</H3>

<P>Limit: &gt; 0.</P>

<P>Specifies the thickness of the output coupler. The actual distance traversed within the element may be larger than the optic thickness due to refraction. See the notes for refractive <A HREF="opt_plat.html">elements</A>.
