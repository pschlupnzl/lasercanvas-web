<P>Brewster-angled Prisms can be inserted into the cavity in pairs. Solitary prisms, as well as prism-like objects such as non-parallel dispersive blocks, are currently not handled by LaserCanvas, since they introduce spatial dispersion and the laser mode becomes more difficult to define.</P>

<P>To insert a prism pair, select menu <U>E</U>dit | <U>I</U>nsert | <U>P</U>rism Pair or click the <NOBR><IMG SRC="but_pris.png" WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20>&nbsp;Prism</NOBR> Pair button on the toolbar.</P>

<P>Only flat <A HREF="opt_mirr.html">mirrors</A> and <A HERF="opt_scrn.html">screens</A> are allowed to be placed between the prisms of a Prism Pair.</P>

<P>Besides deflecting the beam, a prism pair has no effect on the resonator mode. This is because it is assumed that the beam travels through no material (the beam is at the apex of both prisms).</P>




<H3>Refractive Index</H3>

<P>Limit: &gt; 1.</P>

<P>Specifies the refractive index of the prism material. This determines the incidence and refraction angles for the prisms, since the prisms are inserted be at Brewster’s angle. Note that the space between the prisms is in air (vacuum).</P>

<P>This property is not available for Prism B.</P>



<H3>Direction: Flip</H3>
<P>Inverts the sense of the Prism angle. This is equivalent to a negative face angle.</P>
